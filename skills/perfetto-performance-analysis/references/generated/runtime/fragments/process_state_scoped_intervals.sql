-- Framework process-state intervals (android.process_state, trace processors
-- after v58.2) for the requested process. Reads the private stdlib table
-- _android_process_state_intervals and normalizes the shapes it has had:
-- NONEXISTENT rows (pre-birth placeholders) are dropped, and an open interval
-- (dur = -1, e.g. EXITED after death) runs to the end of the trace. EXITED
-- stays in so callers can report it as a lifecycle marker; exclude it from
-- alive time. process_label falls back to process.name, then upid.
-- A process matches by upid, exact name, `name:*` subprocess, or package.
