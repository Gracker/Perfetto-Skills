-- No input CTE. ART garbage collection named by a slice or a log line.
--
-- Slices (GLOB on the original name; a consumer that has lower-cased the
-- name compares it with lower(pattern)):
--   collection  a collector run. ART names every run "<cause> <collector> GC"
--               with collector concurrent copying, concurrent mark compact,
--               (sticky or partial concurrent) mark sweep or semispace:
--               "Background young concurrent copying GC", "Alloc concurrent
--               copying GC", "Background concurrent mark compact GC".
--   wait        a thread blocked on the collector: "GC: Wait For Completion
--               <cause>", waiting for a run or for a GC critical section
--               (ProfileSaver, for one) to end. A wait overlaps what it waits
--               on, so a count or a total takes runs only and reports waits
--               as blocked time.
-- Every pattern contains "GC": a consumer scanning all slices tests
-- s.name GLOB '*GC*' first, which rejects nearly every name before the
-- pattern table is read.
-- Not GC although the name says gc: Collector classes (MetricsCollector,
-- BatchSignalCollector), art::gc::Heap::Trim* heap trimming, a gc() method
-- (SparseArray.gc), logcat, the f2fs_gc thread, and "Lock contention on GC
-- barrier lock" (a microsecond checkpoint). "Lock contention on GC thread
-- flip lock" does block a thread for the concurrent copying flip, but it is
-- lock contention, reported with locks, not counted as GC.
--
-- stdlib android_garbage_collection_events keeps depth-0 "*concurrent*GC"
-- slices that overlap a "Heap size (KB)" counter: a run nested under an app
-- thread slice (an Alloc GC on a blocked thread) or one without that counter
-- is not there, so its count can be lower than one taken with these names.
--
-- Log text (GLOB on the lower-cased text): ART reports a finished run as
-- "<cause> ... GC freed ...", a blocked thread as "WaitForGcToComplete
-- blocked ...", "Waiting for a blocking GC ..." or "Starting a blocking GC
-- ...", and a heap resize as "Clamp target GC heap ...". A bare "gc" word is
-- not enough: it is a method name, a process name or part of a path as
-- often.
