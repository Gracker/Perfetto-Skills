-- No input CTE. The GPU frequency of every GPU as leading intervals, one row
-- per counter sample of the trace_processor "gpufreq" track (the same input
-- and interval shape as stdlib android_gpu_frequency, which returns the raw
-- value), with the value normalized to MHz.
--
-- That track is labelled kHz, but its writers disagree: power/gpu_frequency
-- and generic GPU events write kHz, kgsl_gpu_frequency is multiplied to Hz by
-- trace_processor, and sys_stats gpufreq_mhz writes MHz to GPU 0, so one
-- track can carry two units. Each sample is read by its own magnitude, which
-- is unambiguous for a GPU clock between 10 MHz and 10 GHz:
--   0                  off: the GPU is powered down, not running slowly
--   10 <= v < 1e4      MHz
--   1e4 <= v < 1e7     kHz
--   1e7 <= v <= 1e10   Hz
--   anything else      out_of_domain, freq_mhz NULL
-- prev_freq_mhz is the normalized previous value, so a unit change is not
-- a frequency change. A consumer reports off time apart and
-- leaves it out of averages and low-frequency shares.
