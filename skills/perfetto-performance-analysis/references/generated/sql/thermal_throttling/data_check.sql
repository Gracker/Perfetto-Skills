-- Input: system_windows(window_id, window_start_ts, window_end_ts).
-- The windowed `system_cpu_freq_limit_spans` requires
-- fragments/system_sched_spans.sql to be injected FIRST: policy leader CPUs
-- are classified through its system_cpu_topology, so every CPU Skill shares
-- one big/little definition. The window-independent CTEs (raw samples, data
-- status, reference) read only cpu_counter_track and counter, so a data check
-- may inject this fragment alone.
--
-- Direct cpufreq policy limit evidence from the typed tracks emitted by the
-- ftrace event power/cpu_frequency_limits. `cpu_counter_track.cpu` carries the
-- cpufreq policy leader CPU, not every CPU governed by that policy.
--
-- A track's first sample is the first CHANGE observed, so the state before it
-- is unknown; it is never proof that the policy was unlimited. The per-policy
-- reference is the maximum max-limit observed in this trace and is explicitly
-- labelled `observed_max_limit_in_trace_not_hardware_max`: it cannot establish
-- the hardware or OPP-table maximum.
--
-- `raw_end_ts` is the unclipped end of the value a sample sets: the next
-- sample of the same track, or the trace end for the last one.
--
-- Validity is decided here and nowhere else: a sample whose value is <= 0 is
-- not a limit (`limit_value_valid = 0`). It never enters the reference, and the
-- span it opens is neither capped nor binding. Consumers show it only as a
-- data-quality fact. `prev_sample_*` describe the immediately preceding sample
-- of the same track; the direction of a change is derived from them once, in
-- system_cpu_freq_limit_episodes.sql (system_cpu_freq_limit_samples).
