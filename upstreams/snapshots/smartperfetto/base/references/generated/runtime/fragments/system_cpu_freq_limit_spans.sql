-- Input: system_windows(window_id, window_start_ts, window_end_ts).
-- Requires fragments/system_sched_spans.sql to be injected FIRST: policy
-- leader CPUs are classified through its system_cpu_topology, so every CPU
-- Skill shares one big/little definition.
--
-- Direct cpufreq policy limit evidence from the typed tracks emitted by the
-- ftrace event power/cpu_frequency_limits. `cpu_counter_track.cpu` carries the
-- cpufreq policy leader CPU, not every CPU governed by that policy.
--
-- A track's first sample is the first CHANGE observed, so the state before it
-- is unknown; it is never proof that the policy was unlimited. The per-policy
-- reference is the maximum max-limit observed in this trace and is explicitly
-- labelled `observed_max_limit_in_trace_not_hardware_max`: it cannot establish
-- the hardware or OPP-table maximum.
