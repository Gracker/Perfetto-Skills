-- heapprofd allocations of scoped processes, per (upid, heap_name). Requires
-- fragments/heap_target_process.sql before it. Negative size/count rows are
-- frees: SUM(size) is unreleased bytes, SUM(MAX(size, 0)) is allocated bytes.
-- retention_measurable is the single definition of whether unreleased bytes
-- mean anything: libc.malloc records every free, other heaps only if frees
-- were observed, and com.android.art Java allocation profiles never record GC
-- frees (unreleased == allocated by construction), so they are churn only.
