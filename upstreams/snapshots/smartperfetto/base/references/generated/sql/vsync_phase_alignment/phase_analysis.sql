-- The single read path for stdlib android_input_events. Skill contract:
-- event_action is the uppercase action without the Android prefix (MOVE, DOWN,
-- UP, CANCEL, ...). Newer trace processors report legacy atrace actions as
-- ACTION_MOVE/ACTION_DOWN/ACTION_UP; older ones reported MOVE/DOWN/UP. Every
-- other column passes through unchanged, NULL actions stay NULL. The column
-- list is the set every supported runtime has (v58.2 lacks frame_event_time);
-- keep it aligned with scrolling_analysis's input_data_fallback_view. NOT MATERIALIZED: consumers read it more than once
-- under their own filters, so SQLite should inline it rather than copy the table.
